            <div class="testimonial-carousel"> <div class="testimonial-slide"> <div class="testimonial-item">
                        <p>"My osteopathy and massage appointment with Fen went really well. I was pleasantly surprised by how efficient yet painless the service was. I got help with my hips alignment, ankle movement range and overall strength and flexibility. I immediately felt better after the appointment. Fen is friendly, welcoming, professional and good at explaining things. The wellness centre space is clean, warm and relaxing. I highly recommend Fen for massage and osteopathy."</p>
